#Key
#G = Goal Node
#S = Start Node
#W = Non-walkable Node or Wall
#New test cases are identified with the ==> and after each value must follow a ; even the last 
#value in the line
#Test(number)=answer= is the correct path we expect to be returned after the algorithm has completed
#using '#' means this is a comment

#Test1
#Test to see if a path can be found when the nodes are three spaces apart
#and in the middle of them is a 1 x 3 impassable wall
==>G:47;S:43;W:35;W:45;W:55;
Test1=answer=[47][36][25][34][44][43]

#Test2
#Test to see if the nodes can travel from one corner to the another in this cases
#the start node is <0,0> and the goal node is <9,9>
==>G:99;S:0;
Test2=answer=[99][88][77][66][55][44][33][22][11][0]

#Test3
#Test if the goal node and start node are next to each other
#Testing to ensure the horizontal or vertical gscore is set properly
==>G:0;S:1;
Test3=answer=[0][1]

#Test4
#Test if the goal node and start node are next to each other
#Testing to ensure the diagonal gscore is set properly
==>G:0;S:11;
Test4=answer=[0][11]

#Test5
#Test if the start and goal node are the same
==>G:0;S:0;
Test5=answer=[0]
